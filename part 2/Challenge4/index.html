       <h1>Part 2 </h1>
    <h2>Coding Challenge #4</h2>
    <p>
        Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
    </p>
    <h3>Your tasks:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li class="li">Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values</li>
    <li class="li">Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')</li>
    <li class="li">Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate
tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for
loop to perform the 10 calculations!</li>
  <h3>Test data: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52</h3>
 <h3>Hints: Call â€˜calcTip â€˜in the loop and use the push method to add values to the
tips and totals arrays ðŸ˜‰</h3>
  <li class="li">Bonus: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as
an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given
array. This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to
solve it:
<ol>
    <li>First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition,
start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the
array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the
'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values
added together</li>
    <li>To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the
     length of the array (because that's the number of elements)</li>
    <li>Call the function with the 'totals' array</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <h3>Bonus:</h3>
    </ol>
