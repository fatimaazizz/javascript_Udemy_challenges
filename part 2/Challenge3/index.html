       <h1>Part 2 </h1>
    <h2>Coding Challenge #3</h2>
    <p>
        Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to
implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass
/ (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
    </p>
    <h3>Your tasks:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li class="li">For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and
height (Mark Miller and John Smith)</li>
    <li class="li">Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same
method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it
from the method</li>
    <li class="li">Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the
respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"</li>
  
    </ol>
 <h3>Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m
tall.</h3>
